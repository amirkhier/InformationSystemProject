A system called "check loads/picks and then drive"

## System Functionallity : 

our system addresses this ubiquitous issue by facilitating cooperation between service providers and customers. Through real-time updates on the degree of load at locations, our technological solution enables users to assess and share current load levels. Additionally, our platform offers a comprehensive map of diverse visit complexes nationwide, allowing users to plan trips and search for places based on proximity or specific criteria. The goal is to enhance work processes during peak hours and distribute burdens more equitably among different locations, fostering a more efficient and satisfying experience for both parties involved.
